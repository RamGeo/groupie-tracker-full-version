## 🌐 How It Works
- The backend (written in Go) listens on http://localhost:8080 and serves all pages and static files.
-  On visiting the homepage, the server fetches artist data from an API and dynamically renders it on the page.
- Clicking on any artist will open a modal with more details: members, creation date, first album, locations, and concert dates.
- The app provides custom error handling. If something goes wrong, a friendly error page is shown to the user.
- The About Us page explains the team and the inspiration behind the project.

### 🛑 Status Codes
- **200 OK**: Successfully processed the request.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource or page does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Something went wrong on the server.
